                                    Cookies are files that a website typically sends to a user browsing the site. They usually contain two pieces of information; a site name and user ID. These files are downloaded to your PC when you first visit a website. When you revisit a site, your PC checks if it has a relevant cookie and if so uploads this to the site. The site can then check if you have previously visited and tailor information to suit you and can vary content for example, depending on whether you are a new user or not.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mb-3">
                                    The main reason we use cookies on our site is for login. Session cookies are used as the server needs to store who is logged in so that it can send specific settings to that person. i.e. pricing.
                                </p>

                                    We use google analytics on our website. This uses cookies by default so that we can track usage of our site, for instance how many unique visitors versus total visits.
                                </p>

                                    You can simply change your browser settings to configure whether cookies are accepted or not. For example: In Google Chrome click settings on the top right hand corner of your browser screen (to the right of the star) Search “Cookies” in the search bar and click “content settings”. Cookies can also easily be deleted. For example: In Google Chrome follow the example above but after you click “content settings” click “All cookies and site data” then cookies can be deleted from the list or all cookies removed using the “Remove all” button. If you use another browser refer to your browser documentation in order to find the relevant settings. If you have any queries regarding our use of cookies or anything else please do not hesitate to contact us.
